## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
✔️ Python 3.8+  
✔️ Flask  
✔️ Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Pickle  

---

### Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/heart-disease-predictor.git  
   cd heart-disease-predictor  
   ```  

2. Install required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

---

### Running the Project  
1. Start the Flask backend server:  
   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```
